# Wordle

A play with word lists and positional counts in 5-letter words.

It's in Racket because (a) it's a Lisp, and (b) it comes with useful stuff out of the box.

## Features

* Load a word list from a file
* Extract counts of letters in each position
* Score a given word against the position counts
* Rank the words by decreasing score
* Filter a word list against a regexp
